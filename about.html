            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <article>

                <p> This is my first Pc build for a customer and I thought id
                    share
                    my expernce and thoughts about it.</p>

                <p>PC Build Thought Process (about me)

                    Building a personal computer (PC) takes time and
                    problem-solving
                    skills. This challenged me to think critically and
                    solve
                    issues
                    that arose during the process. I knew it would be
                    tricky at
                    times, but I was ready to give it my best shot. My
                    journey
                    into
                    PC building started with excitement, but I was also
                    nervous
                    because it was my first time building a PC for
                    someone else,
                    especially for someone who needed it to do their
                    job. There
                    was
                    a lot at stake.</p>

                <p>Over the summer, my dads friend asked him if I would
                    like to
                    help him with a project. My dad told me about the
                    idea and I
                    agreed to it. The goal was to help build a PC in
                    under a
                    week. I
                    got the parts on wednesday from my dads friend. I
                    started by
                    unboxing everything and started in my basement. The
                    first
                    step
                    of this project was to get out the motherboard and
                    case. The
                    case for where the parts would be stored, and the
                    motherboard
                    for everything to be connected and to work properly.
                    I got
                    the
                    ram and CPU, and then put them in the motherboard
                    socket.
                    When
                    putting the CPU in, you want to be careful because
                    you could
                    bend one of the tiny thousands of gold pins that are
                    on the
                    CPU.
                    I inserted the CPU in and it clicked which was a
                    good thing
                    knowing it was in and not out of place. I grabbed
                    the two
                    ram
                    sticks. Personal Computers are usually around $1.5k
                    to about
                    $3k
                    depending on the parts but since this was for a
                    programmer
                    he
                    needed a lot of ram and storage and processing. I
                    took the
                    RAM
                    and put them into the slots A2 and B2.
                    After a couple of hours working on the Personal
                    Computers,
                    and
                    getting things into place and checking for things I
                    took out
                    the
                    power supply and the cooler. This cooler was way
                    different
                    than
                    the coolers I have worked on in the past. This was
                    bigger
                    and
                    had more parts to it and more steps. I grabbed it
                    and I took
                    the
                    three fans and decided on what I wanted the fans to
                    do
                    whether
                    they were intake fans, which brings cool air into
                    the pc to
                    flow
                    and cool down) or out take fans (taking the hot air
                    out of
                    the
                    PC,. I decided on two in and one out. You usually
                    want more
                    cooling than outtake . When adding this cooler there
                    were
                    these
                    brackets that came with them but there were multiple
                    kinds
                    of
                    brackets for different types of motherboards. When I
                    put the
                    block aka the cooler part. It got on me thinking it
                    was on
                    and
                    well fitted.</p>
                <p>This was the test to see if it would work or not. I
                    turned it
                    on
                    and it posted and then shut off instantly. I didn't
                    know
                    what
                    happened. I checked for 20 mins and I tried
                    something I
                    never
                    would've thought of. I put a card under the block
                    and the
                    CPU.
                    The card slid straight through and I found out I had
                    put on
                    the
                    wrong brackets. After about an hour or so of working
                    on the
                    pc.
                    I put the new brackets on and succeeded.
                    This Pc build showed me not to quit but rather keep
                    going
                    and
                    not be satisfied until I had figured it out. I was
                    glad to
                    learn
                    and gain more experience in building. This project
                    was fun
                    and I
                    got paid for it as well. It was nice to help someone
                    out but
                    also gain some knowledge. And yes, I finished the PC
                    in
                    three
                    days.</p>
